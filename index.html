        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Among other things, the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] specifies the models used for Verifiable Credentials,
          Verifiable Presentations, and explains the relationships between three parties:
          <i>issuers</i>, <i>holders</i>, and <i>verifiers</i>. Critical pieces of functionality referenced
          throughout the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] are the that of of verifiability, extensibility, and semantic
          interoperability. This specification provides a mechanism to make use of a Credential Schema in
          <a>Verifiable Credential</a>, leveraging the existing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#data-schemas">Data Schemas</a> concept.

        <h2>Status of This Document</h2>
         <p>
            This document is experimental and is undergoing heavy development.
            It is inadvisable to implement the specification in its current form.
            An <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/tree/main/credential/schema">experimental
            implementation</a> is available.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>
            This specification provides a mechanism for the use of <a>JSON Schemas</a> with
            <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. A significant part of the integrity of a <a>Verifiable Credential</a>
            comes from the ability to structure its contents so that all three parties —
            issuer, holder, verifier — may have a consistent mechanism of trust in
            interpreting the data that they are provided with. We introducing a new data
            model for an object to facilitate backing Credentials with <a>JSON Schemas</a>
            that we call a <a>Credential Schema</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            This specification provides a standardized way of creating <a>Credential Schemas</a>
            to be used in credentialing systems. Credential Schemas may apply to any portion
            of a Verifiable Credential. Multiple JSON Schemas may back a single Verifiable Credential,
            e.g. a schema for the `credentialSubject` and another for other credential properties.

            <h3>Metadata</h3>
            <p>
               When an <a>issuer</a> desires to enable JSON Schema validation for a
               <a>verifiable credential</a> they MAY add the following data which
               wraps a <i>schema</i> to be applied to the credential.
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
               <thead>
                  <tr>

                     <td>
                        The <code>id</code> value is expected to be a URL that identifies the credential
                        schema associated with the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The value of the <code>id</code>
                        property MUST point to a locally unique identifier which addresses the schema
                        on a given data storage medium (e.g. a database, ledger, distributed file store).
                        Each credential schema has its own unique identifier and each revision of a schema
                        is required to have its own unique identifier.
                        It is <i>RECOMMENDED</i> that this identifier is a
                        <a href="ttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986">Uniform Resource Identifier</a> which
                        SHOULD contain information pertaining to the issuer and version of the schema.
                        For example, if the issuer controls a DID 
                        <pre>did:example:abcdefghi</pre>
                        a possible schema ID the issuer created would have an identifier such as:
                        <pre>did:example:abcdefghi/17de181feb67447da4e78259d92d0240?version=1</pre>

                        as defined by [[DID-CORE]].

                        that the name is human-friendly and fits the credential schema.

          <p>
            Credential schemas MAY be packaged as <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
            Should this be the case, the credential containing a <a>credential schema</a>
            may include a proof, either embedded according to [[DATA-INTEGRITY]] or
            packaged as a [[VC-JWT]].
          </p>
          <p>
            Secured credentials that contain credential schemas should first be validated
            according to the rules set out in the aforementioned securing specifications

          <h3>Schema Extraction</h3>
          <p>
            If a Credential Schema contains <a href="#metadata">metadata</a>, extraction
            is necessary to dereference the value of the <code>schema</code> property
            within the metadata. Otherwise, extraction is not necessary.

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            Validation of a given Credential against its schema is to be performed according
            to its associated [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]] specification. Should validation
            succeed the credential should be considered to be valid against its
            <a>credential schema</a>.

        <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          This section details some issues implementers of the specification
          may consider.
        </p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h3>Validation of Specific Properties in a Credential</h3>
          <p>
            Implementers may wish to validate certain sections of a <a>verifiable credential</a>.
            To do this, <a>credential schemas</a> can be constructed to specify application
            to subsets of a given credential.
          </p>
          <p>
            One example of such a construction would be to validate the presence of certain
            top-level properties in a <a>verifiable credential</a>. The following example
            demonstrates a schema which enforces that a credential issued against it
            has an <code>validUntil</code> property and includes <code>evidence</code>.

              "description": "Schema requiring validUntil and evidence properties",
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "validUntil": {
                  "type": "object"
                },
                "evidence": {
                  "type": "object"
                }
              },
              "required": ["validUntil", "evidence"]

        <section class="informative">
          <h3>Additional Properties</h3>
          <p>
            In using [[JSON-Schema]] it is advised that implementers avoid
            setting the <code>additionalProperties</code> to <i>false</i>. Doing
            so could inadvertently exclude properties in a credential from passing
            validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, consider a credential schema that is intended to validate
            the <code>credentialSubject</code> property of a credential. It is common
            for the <code>credentialSubject</code> property to include an <code>id</code>,
            denoting the identifier the subject. Not including this <code>id</code> property
            in a given schema would result in validation failure. The simple alternative
            is to avoid setting <code>additionalProperties</code> to <i>false</i>.

          <p>
            Versioning is not provided as an explicit feature of this specification.
            It is advised to make backwards compatabile changes to schemas, should
            they be adjusted. Otherwise, it is advised that a new <a>credential schema</a>
            is created with a unique identifier.

        <section class="informative">
          <h3>Storage</h3>
          <p>
            Credential schemas are intended to be created and made available as <b>immutable</b>
            objects. They may be stored on any number of storage mediums such as a distributed
            ledger, traditional database, or decentralized file storage. The same schema <i>may</i>
            be replicated across multiple file stores with the same identifier.

            Immutability is key to enable consistent sources of truth for usage with <a>verifiable
            credentials</a> which are also immutable.

        <section class="informative">
          <h3>Multiple Schemas</h3>
          <p>
            A common use case is to include multiple schemas to validate against which a single
            <a>verifiable Credential</a>. One such use case is to utilize <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/blob/main/schema/verifiable-credential/verifiable-credential-schema.json">the JSON Schema defined by the</a> [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] in addition to a schema to validate a specific property in the credential, such as the <code>credentialSubject</code>. Multiple schemas MAY be combined using native constructs from the [[JSON-SCHEMA]] specification, through utilizing properties such as <code>oneOf</code>, <code>anyOf</code>, or <code>allOf</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of how to construct such a schema using the [[JSON-SCHEMA]] property
            <code>allOf</code> is provided below, combining schemas for a <a>verifiable credential</a>,
            name, and email address:

          <h3>Validity of a Verifiable Credential</h3>
          <p>
            Validation against a [[JSON-SCHEMA]] may be confused with
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential-validation">validation</a>
            or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verify">verification</a>
            of a Verifiable Credential. A valid credential according to a [[JSON-SCHEMA]] refers
            only to the structure of the claims comprising a Verifiable Credential. This idea of
            validity does not imply anything about the validity of the Verifiable Credential itself.
            It's possible for a Verifiable Credential to be considered valid by one verifier,
            while another verifier would not consider it valid.

          <h3>Relationship to Verifiable Credential Type Property</h3>

            property contains a specific <code>type</code>. In this scenario, it is adbised to use the value of the specific type as the name property of

            It is important to note that a <a>credential schema</a> enables issuers to communicate how to process
            the structure of data inside a verifiable credential, whereas the <code>type</code> property of a <a>verifiable credential</a>
            lets issuers communicate the semantics of the data. It is advised to associate all properties
            that have a semantic mapping with a property in a <a>credential schema</a>.

            This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
            implications of deploying this specification into production environments.

            <h3>Verifier Caching</h3>
            <p>
               Since schemas are immutable, they are highly cachable.
               It is possible for <a>verifiers</a> to increase the privacy of the
               <a>holder</a> whose <a>verifiable credential</a> is being checked by caching
               schemas that have been fetched from remote servers. By caching the
               content locally, less correlatable information can be inferred from
               <a>verifier</a>-based access patterns on the schema.

            <h3>Content Distribution Networks</h3>
            <p>
               The use of content distribution networks by <a>issuers</a> can increase the
               privacy of <a>holders</a> by reducing or eliminating requests for the
               schemas lists from the <a>issuer</a>. Often, a request for a schema
               list will be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load
               on the server as well as cloaking <a>verifiers</a> and <a>holders</a>
               from <a>issuers</a>.

         <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
         <p>
            There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
            aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
            not understanding the implications of this section can result in
            security vulnerabilities.

            <h3>Issuer Impersonation</h3>
            <p>
               It is possible for a schema to become authoritative, such as schemas
               provided by a recognized industry group like a consoritum of financial
               companies. To avoid confusion as to the authorship of <a>credential schemas</a>
               it is advised that they are packaged as secured <a>verifiable credentials</a>.

         <p>
            There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
            aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
            standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
            this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
            to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
            all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
            especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
            have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

         <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>
         <p>
            There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
            aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
            standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
            difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
            languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
            specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
