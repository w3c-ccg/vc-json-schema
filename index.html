        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Among other things, the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] specifies the models used for Verifiable Credentials,
          Verifiable Presentations, and explains the relationships between three parties:
          <i>issuers</i>, <i>holders</i>, and <i>verifiers</i>. Critical pieces of functionality referenced
          throughout the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] are the that of verifiability, extensibility, and semantic
          interoperability. This specification provides a mechanism to make use of a Credential Schema in
          <a>Verifiable Credential</a>, leveraging the existing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#data-schemas">Data Schemas</a> concept.

        <h2>Status of This Document</h2>
         <p>
            This document is experimental and is undergoing heavy development.
            It is inadvisable to implement the specification in its current form.
            An <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/tree/main/credential/schema">experimental
            implementation</a> is available.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>
            This specification provides a mechanism for the use of <a>JSON Schemas</a> with
            <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. A significant part of the integrity of a <a>Verifiable Credential</a>
            comes from the ability to structure its contents so that all three parties —
            issuer, holder, verifier — may have a consistent mechanism of trust in
            interpreting the data that they are provided with. We introducing a new data
            model for an object to facilitate backing Credentials with <a>JSON Schemas</a>
            that we call a <a>Credential Schema</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            This specification provides a standardized way of creating <a>Credential Schemas</a>
            to be used in credentialing systems. Credential Schemas may apply to any portion
            of a Verifiable Credential. Multiple JSON Schemas may back a single Verifiable Credential,
            e.g. a schema for the `credentialSubject` and another for other credential properties.

        <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          This section details some issues implementers of the specification

        <section class="informative">
          <h3>Validation of Specific Properties in a Credential</h3>
          <p>
            Implementers may wish to validate certain sections of a <a>verifiable credential</a>.
            To do this, <a>credential schemas</a> can be constructed to specify application
            to subsets of a given credential.
          </p>
          <p>
            One example of such a construction would be to validate the presence of certain
            top-level properties in a <a>verifiable credential</a>. The following example
            demonstrates a schema which enforces that a credential issued against it
            has an <code>validUntil</code> property and includes <code>evidence</code>.

          <h3>Additional Properties</h3>
          <p>
            In using [[JSON-Schema]] it is advised that implementers avoid
            setting the <code>additionalProperties</code> to <i>false</i>. Doing
            so could inadvertently exclude properties in a credential from passing
            validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, consider a credential schema that is intended to validate
            the <code>credentialSubject</code> property of a credential. It is common
            for the <code>credentialSubject</code> property to include an <code>id</code>,
            denoting the identifier the subject. Not including this <code>id</code> property
            in a given schema would result in validation failure. The simple alternative
            is to avoid setting <code>additionalProperties</code> to <i>false</i>.

            or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verify">verification</a>
            of a Verifiable Credential. A valid credential according to a [[JSON-SCHEMA]] refers
            only to the structure of the claims comprising a Verifiable Credential. This idea of
            validity does not imply anything about the validity of the Verifiable Credential itself.
            It's possible for a Verifiable Credential to be considered valid by one verifier,
            while another verifier would not consider it valid.

            It is important to note that a <a>credential schema</a> enables issuers to communicate how to process
            the structure of data inside a verifiable credential, whereas the <code>type</code> property of a <a>verifiable credential</a>
            lets issuers communicate the semantics of the data. It is advised to associate all properties
            that have a semantic mapping with a property in a <a>credential schema</a>.

         <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
         <p>
            This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
            implications of deploying this specification into production environments.

         <section class="informative">
            <h3>Verifier Caching</h3>
            <p>
               Since schemas are immutable, they are highly cachable.
               It is possible for <a>verifiers</a> to increase the privacy of the
               <a>holder</a> whose <a>verifiable credential</a> is being checked by caching
               schemas that have been fetched from remote servers. By caching the
               content locally, less correlatable information can be inferred from
               <a>verifier</a>-based access patterns on the schema. 
            </p>
         </section>
         <section class="informative">
            <h3>Content Distribution Networks</h3>
            <p>
               The use of content distribution networks by <a>issuers</a> can increase the
               privacy of <a>holders</a> by reducing or eliminating requests for the
               schemas lists from the <a>issuer</a>. Often, a request for a schema
               list will be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load
               on the server as well as cloaking <a>verifiers</a> and <a>holders</a>
               from <a>issuers</a>.

         <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
         <p>
            There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
            aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
            not understanding the implications of this section can result in
            security vulnerabilities.

            <h3>Issuer Impersonation</h3>
            <p>
               It is possible for a schema to become authoritative, such as schemas
               provided by a recognized industry group like a consoritum of financial
               companies. To avoid confusion as to the authorship of <a>credential schemas</a>
               it is advised that they are packaged as secured <a>verifiable credentials</a>.

         <p>
            There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
            aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
            standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
            this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
            to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
            all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
            especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
            have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

         <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>
         <p>
            There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
            aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
            standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
            difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
            languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
            specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
